# How to Access the Coordinator Role

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**

The 401 Unauthorized error has been resolved by updating the frontend to support the coordinator role:

1. **Updated User Interface**: Added `'coordinator'` to the role type definitions
2. **Added Coordinator API**: Created coordinator API endpoints in the frontend
3. **Updated Navigation**: Added coordinator-specific menu items and routing
4. **Created Dashboard**: Added a basic coordinator dashboard with navigation
